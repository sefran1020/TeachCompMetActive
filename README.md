# Research Project: Teaching Competencies and Active Methodology

This repository contains the data and analysis for a research project investigating teaching competencies and active methodology in higher education.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders and an analysis file:

### 1. Pilot Study (`piloto/`)

This folder contains the results of the pilot study, with two CSV files:

- `competenciasDocentesPiloto.csv`: Data on teaching competencies from the pilot study
- `metodologiaActivaPiloto.csv`: Data on active methodology from the pilot study

Each variable in the pilot study is divided into three dimensions:
- Dimension 1: 7 items
- Dimension 2: 7 items
- Dimension 3: 6 items

### 2. Main Study (`cuestionario/`)

This folder contains the results of the main questionnaire, administered to 166 students from various programs in the Faculty of Humanities:

- `competenciasDocentesTotal.csv`: Complete data on teaching competencies
- `metodologiaActivaTotal.csv`: Complete data on active methodology

### 3. Analysis File

- `analisisFinal.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the Python code used to analyze the questionnaire results

## Data Structure

Both the pilot and main study data are structured similarly:

1. Teaching Competencies:
   - Dimension 1: 7 items
   - Dimension 2: 7 items
   - Dimension 3: 6 items

2. Active Methodology:
   - Dimension 1: 7 items
   - Dimension 2: 7 items
   - Dimension 3: 6 items

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and the necessary Python libraries.
2. Open `analisisFinal.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells to perform the analysis on the data from the `cuestionario/` folder.
